# NLP-Weather-Disaster
 
Project Name: NLP-Weather-Disaster

Model Used: MultinomialNB (Multinomial Naive Bayes)

Objective: Analyzing weather-related text data to predict and classify disaster events

Data Collection: Gathered a diverse dataset containing weather-related text data from various sources such as social media, news articles, and weather reports

Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the text data by removing noise, stop words, and special characters, and performed tokenization

Feature Extraction: Utilized techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical feature vectors
