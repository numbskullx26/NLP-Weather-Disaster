# NLP-Weather-Disaster
 
Project Name: NLP-Weather-Disaster

Model Used: MultinomialNB (Multinomial Naive Bayes)

Objective: Analyzing weather-related text data to predict and classify disaster events

Data Collection: Gathered a diverse dataset containing weather-related text data from various sources such as social media, news articles, and weather reports

Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the text data by removing noise, stop words, and special characters, and performed tokenization

Feature Extraction: Utilized techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical feature vectors

Model Training: Employed the MultinomialNB model, a popular algorithm for text classification tasks, to train on the preprocessed text data

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in classifying weather-related disaster events

Results: Obtained promising results with high accuracy and reliable predictions for different weather-related disaster categories

Deployment: Integrated the trained model into a user-friendly interface or application to allow real-time classification of weather-related texts

Practical Applications: This project has various practical applications, including:

Early warning systems: By classifying weather-related texts, the model can aid in the early detection and prediction of disasters, enabling timely alerts and preparation.

Emergency response: Providing insights into disaster events can help emergency response teams prioritize and allocate resources effectively.

Social media monitoring: The model can be utilized to monitor social media platforms for real-time updates on weather-related disasters, enabling faster responses and assistance.
